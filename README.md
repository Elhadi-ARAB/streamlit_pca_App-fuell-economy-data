# Project Description

This project is an application that allows for exploring the relationship between different metrics in a dataset. The data used has been extracted from the fueleconomy.gov website and has undergone various manipulations to facilitate understanding. The main objective of this project is to utilize the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) method to reduce the variables present in the dataset to a 2D representation.

## Features

* Importing data from fueleconomy.gov website.
* Data manipulation to prepare the dataset for analysis.
* Utilizing Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensions of the variables.
* Visualization of the relationship between variables in a 2D space.

## Technologies Used 

Python
* Streamlit
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Plotly
* Seaborn
* Scikit-learn

## Note

This project has been developed as part of personal learning and aims to demonstrate the use of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to explore relationships between variables in a dataset. It can be extended and enhanced to include additional features and analyses based on specific requirements.
